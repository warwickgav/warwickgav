					<p>For over 6 years I've worked at eCommerce Websites where I began as a Junior Web Designer - designing online stores for our clients. I became a Frontend Designer & Developer in 2010 for our projects with Harvey Norman where I developed my own CSS Framework and developed the Template architecture. I returned to the main business of eCommerce Websites in 2014 and we split our platform, ShopFrontPro, into a separate business. I took the reigns as the UX Designer - helping shape the product, Frontend Designer & Developer - actually building the product, and Head of Design - developing the client-side custom design process.</p>
					<p>Now I'm ready to take the next step, to challenge myself once more and work with some fresh faces that share the same passion I do. I want to work with an exciting team who strive to design solutions that empower people, are thoughtful in approach, and allow us to spend more time living life.</p>
