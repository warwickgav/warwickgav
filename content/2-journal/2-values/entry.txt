	<h3>Be Brave</h3>
	<p>Don't be afraid to succeed because you're afraid of failing. No one got it right the first time.</p>
	<h3>Take a breathe</h3>
	<p>Sometimes not doing anything at all can make all the difference. Know when to step back, take a breathe, and let it all sink in.</p>
	<h3>Delight</h3>
	<p>Making a good experiences is easy, but making one that delights is not.</p>
	<h3>People not Users</h3>
	<p>Users are numbers. People are not. People are irrational, emotional, empathetic, and joyous - design for them.</p>
	<h3>Always learning</h3>
	<p>Education doesn't end after University. Throughout your life you will continue to learn - through both failure and success.</p>
	<h3>Equilibrium</h3>
	<p>Burning the candle at both ends doesn't make you a better designer. Balancing work with life, the physical with the emotional, and the mental with the spiritual - finding the equilibrium with these is key.</p>
