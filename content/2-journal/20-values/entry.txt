Text:

<strong>1. Be Brave</strong> and take chances. Don't be afraid to voice the unpopular opinion, start from scratch or jump in the deep end.

<strong>2. Fail. Learn. Grow.</strong> Stagnation is an enemy to all, it topples the mightiest and only through learning from failure can we grow.

<strong>3. Sharing is caring.</strong>

<strong>4. Step back.</strong> It pays to see the bigger picture and that means stepping away from the canvas to see what you've painted.

<strong>5. Don't wait for happiness.</strong> Happiness is a journey, you earn and lose it along the way, it doesn't just happen.

I don't know if these are really values or ramblings but I felt the need to write down the things I felt are important to me as a person.
