Understanding why a designer makes certain decisions has become a recent pursuit of mine as I've explored and attempted to explain to my clients my own decision making. While decisions are, seemingly, made on instinct or a 'feeling' there is usually a deeper reason rooted at the core of our choices.

In order to deconstruct my decisions I'm highlighting different facets of my life that have inspired me. This month I'm starting with books, looking at which books have had the greatest inspiration in my life.

####The Design of Everyday Things####
This book has probably come up a lot amongst designers so I'll try not to re-tread old ground. *The Design of Everyday Things* marks the beginning of my love and fascination with design. It has been some years since I've read it but from what I recall it stresses the importance of design as effective first and clever second.

####The Shape of Design####
I'd reached a routine with my job as a design after about a 2 years and was lamenting the lack of 'creativity' involved in churning out website after website. It wasn't until I read *The Shape of Design* that was I shook from my reverie and the truth of the problem made clear, it was my attitude. I was treating each job begrudgingly, viewing each as not a challenge or chance to do something great - to expand my capabilities, but as ones that were stifling them. In others words I was being ungrateful and spoilt.

After that I started treating my clients differently, putting more care and thought into each website, and even if the result wasn't spectacular I was feeling more fulfilled knowing I'd put in my best effort.

Maybe I've put too much hype behind this book but it meant a lot to me when I was in a time of crisis.

####All Marketers Are Liars####
I read this in the beginning on my journey to re-imagining ShopFrontPro. It highlighted that the truly great products, the ones that endure, don't focus on features but stories. At the same time he stresses the importance of authenticity, the need to not just stand by your word, but live and breath it everyday.

####The Antidote####
Happiness is something so many of presume we are owed yet in *The Antidote*, we learn how it is something that is earned, not acquired. He analyses the pitfalls of 'positive thinking' and many self-help regimes and explores the philosophy of life, death and happiness.

####The One Thing####
Day-to-day tasks, meetings, emails - these always seemed to get out of hand and lead to so much stress in my life. After reading *The One Thing* I learnt how to re-organise my life, cut through the cruft and overcome that overwhelming feeling.

####The E-Myth Revisited####
Switching from a technical role to a strategic role has been a difficult transition. I'd wondered why I was struggling to break free from my technical role and focusing my efforts on the strategic. This book taught me the importance of systems and how, when applied correctly, can not only lead to a more productive business but a successful one.

####Delivering Happiness####
*Delivering Happiness* brings together everything from the previous books and then some. Stressing the importance of delivering happiness not just to customers but to the ones who run the business. Tony Shieh's journey is a fascinating one that really resonates with how I want to build a business that finds its voice, just as his did. If you could only read one book on this list make it this one.
