<blockquote class="bq-standard">"...but..."</blockquote>

A dangerous word a designer or developer can ever utter at the beginning, midst or end of a project. As a preposition, adverb, or noun it more often than not presumes an excuse to "not do something". For years I'd used this word as an excuse;

<blockquote class="bq-line">"But I don't have time right now..."</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bq-line">"But I'm right in the middle of X"</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bq-line">"But it can't be done because of A,B,C"</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bq-line">"But I could do it properly next time"</blockquote>

And it resulted in so much regret and frustration over the years. Yet recent events have forced me to look back at the path I've trodden and reflect on what it is I actually want to do.

For over 6 years I've worked at the same company producing websites Over time I'd discovered the importance of planning and tackled my responsibilities in a new light. I rewrote the structure of our CSS making it more manageable, modular, and leveraged the power of a preprocessor. In turn my work flow changed, developers could now easily build much of the UI without a designer - they still needed one since they weren't sure how to make things 'look good'.
