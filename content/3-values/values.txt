Title: Values

Text:

<strong>1. Be brave</strong> and take chances. Don't be afraid to start just because you're afraid fail.

<strong>2. Fail. Learn. Grow.</strong> Stagnation is an enemy to all, it topples the mightiest and only through learning from failure can we grow.

<strong>3. Care.</strong> Passion can only take you so far. You need to <em>care</em> about the problem to be in the right frame of mind to solve it.

<strong>4. Step back.</strong> It pays to see the bigger picture and that means stepping away from the canvas to see what you've painted.

<strong>5. Don't wait for happiness.</strong> Happiness is a journey, you earn and lose it along the way, it doesn't just happen.

<strong>6. Be human.</strong> You're designing for humans so design with care, feeling, and consideration.

<strong>7. Be humble.</strong> Celebrate your triumphs but be considerate. Most projects are a group effort and acknowledging everyone's role is important.

I don't know if these are really values or ramblings but I felt the need to write down the things I felt are important to me as a person.
