Title: The Baby Gift Company

Project_Date: 2015

Details: UX & UI Design

Lead: lead.jpg

----

Intro: The Baby Gift Company had been a client of ours for several years and while they'd had minor changes made to the site, over time these elements were conflicting with the original design. They approached us with a clear goal of re-designing their home page, focusing more on their key product - baby gift boxes, and cleaning the overall art direction for the store.

----

Responsibilities:

<ul>
	<li>Improve existing UI through consistent application of colours, typeface and overall art direction</li>
	<li>Home page redesign with greater focus on primary selling point</li>
	<li>Rebuild the site for responsiveness across mobile, tablet and desktop screens</li>
</ul>
