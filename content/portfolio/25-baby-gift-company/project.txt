Intro: The Baby Gift Company have been a client of ours for several years and while they'd had minor changes made to the site over time these elements were inconsistent. They approached us with a clear goal of simplifying their home page and focusing on their key product - baby gift boxes.

Responsibilities:

<ul>
	<li>Improve existing UI through consistent application of colours, typeface and overall art direction</li>
	<li>Home page redesign with greater focus on primary selling point</li>
	<li>Rebuild the site for responsiveness across mobile, tablet and desktop screens</li>
</ul>

		<h5>Art Direction</h5>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Extreme SAS's previous design did not accurately reflect their identity as experts in the field of camping, hunting, fishing & outdoor gear.
			In turn this reduced the perceived quality of their products when in truth their products are of the highest quality sourced from overseas and locally.</p>
           	<p>Utilising their logo as a base I created 3 cards to emphasise the core categories of products they sell. These would end up being the focal point, emphasizing sport, adventure, and survival.</p>
            <figure class="center"><img src="/portfolio/extreme-sas/feature-1.jpg" width="1220" height="600"></figure>
            <p>These cards helped me build the overall visual style, type choice, and the colour scheme that I would use throughout the project.</p>
