Details: Art Direction - UI Design

Intro: I re-designed the overall interface for Extreme SAS's online store to convey a more adventurous experience catering to the 3 different types of customers they engaged with. They wanted to make it clear to customers the breadth and quality of the products they offered. Through new visual components the store now strongly conveys their brand, their intent and their offerings.

		<h5>Art Direction</h5>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Extreme SAS's previous design did not accurately reflect their identity as experts in the field of camping, hunting, fishing & outdoor gear.
			In turn this reduced the perceived quality of their products when in truth their products are of the highest quality sourced from overseas and locally.</p>
           	<p>Utilising their logo as a base I created 3 cards to emphasise the core categories of products they sell. These would end up being the focal point, emphasizing sport, adventure, and survival.</p>

            <p>These cards helped me build the overall visual style, type choice, and the colour scheme that I would use throughout the project.</p>
